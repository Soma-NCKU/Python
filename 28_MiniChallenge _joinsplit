# join method will create a string from a sequence such as a list split as shown above.
# whereas, split method will string up the string and create a list.
# Split is very useful when reading data from a file , for instance.

# Mini-Challenge
# USe a for loop to replace all the string in that above list with integer values.

# In other words, use a for loop to produce a list of ints rather than strings.
print("-" * 80)
print(type(values_new))

value_item = []
for item in values_new:
    #print(item)
    value_item.append(int(item))

print(value_item)

# ------------------------------------
# another example string data (str) and interge data (int)
print("*" * 80)
a = '2'
b = '3'

# print the data type of a and b
print(type(a))
print(type(b))

# convert a using float
a = float(a)

# convert b using int
b = int(b)

# sum both integers
sum = a + b

# as strings and integers can't be added
# try testing the sum
print(sum)

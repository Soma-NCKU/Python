# PYTHON STRING OPERATOR -- Python sequence types
# Python 3 has 5 built-in sequence types,as,
# 1. the string type
# 2. list
# 3. tuple
# 4. range
# 5. bytes and bytearray

# What is a sequence - order set of items e.g. "Hello World" contains 11 items, and each item is a character
# List is also a sequence - e.g. ["computer", "mouse", "keyboard", "mouse"] ,
# ie. the list contain 5 items, each of which is a string.

# Note: Indexing is very important in sequence .. as Sequence is ordered.
# One can use indexes to access individual items in the sequence.

computer_parts = ["computer", "mouse", "keyboard", "mouse"]
print(computer_parts[0][0])
print(computer_parts[1][2])

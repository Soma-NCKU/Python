# Python provides several ways to repeat a block of code - things like:
# 1. for loops 2. while loops
# 3. list comprehensions and generator expressions

# we focus only on for loop - a for loop works by iterating over some set of values.
# The set of values comes from a sequence, or some other iterable objects.
# We have seen one sequence type - "string" type and one iterable type - "range".
# Sequence is also an iterable.

parrot = "Norwegian Blue"

# for variable_name in another_variable:
for character in parrot:
    print(character)

# Another example we see examine how each character in the number string to check if it's a digit or not
# As we saw in the previous video, a for loop can be used to do that.
# we are going to iterate over numbers, and append anything that isnt a digit to the separators string.
number = "9,223;372:036 854,775;807"
separators = number[1::4]
print(separators)

print()

numbers = "9,223;372:036 854,775;807"
separatorss = ""

for char in numbers:
    if not char.isnumeric():                   # not False -> move next line whereas not True -> move back to first
        separatorss = separatorss + char

print(separatorss)

values = "".join(char if char not in separatorss else "" for char in numbers).split()
print([int(val) for val in values])


# Some examples to understand isnumeric()
#The isnumeric() method returns:

# True if all characters in the string are numeric characters.
# False if at least one character is not a numeric character.
s = '1242323'
print(s.isnumeric())

#s = '²3455'
s = '\u00B23455'
print(s.isnumeric())

# s = '½'
s = '\u00BD'
print(s.isnumeric())

s = '1242323'
s='python12'
print(s.isnumeric())

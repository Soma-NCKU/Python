# CONTINUE (with LOOPS)
# Note: Sometimes, we may need to intruppt the normal flow of a loop, either to jump out of it completely, or
# to stop the current iteration and move on to the next one.

# Some example to show how they work :
# List - is an ordered sequence of values, enclosed in square brackets.

shopping_list = ["milk", "pasta", "eggs", "spam", "bread", "rice"]
#for item in shopping_list:
#    if item != "spam":
#        print("Buy " + item)

for item in shopping_list:
    if item == "spam":
        continue

    print("Buy " + item)
    
    print()

# BREAK
for item in shopping_list:
    if item == "spam":
        break

    print("Buy " + item)

print()

item_to_find = "albatross"     # enter the item name
found_at = None           # constant

# In the following program we will loop over the index position rather the item itself

# for index in range(60:
for index in range(len(shopping_list)):
    if shopping_list[index] == item_to_find:
        found_at = index
        break                       # check the loop without the break statement and with the break statement

print("Item found at position {}". format(found_at))

# Another way to write

if found_at is not None:
    print("Item found at position {}".format(found_at))
else:
    print("{} not found".found(item_to_find))

# Python has several built-in data types, that are classified as,
# 1. numeric
# 2. iterator
# 3. sequence (which are also iterates)
# 4. mapping
# 5. file
# 6. class
# 7. exception


# str type - we have already seen is previous exercises

# Here we will focus on Numeric data type. - int ( whole number )  - float (decimal number)

# Remember - Python 3 int effectively has no maximum size , therefore you can come across a scenrio where you will
# run out of memory before you exceed the size limit.

# Note - Python does not have type declarations (where you specify the type of a variable before you can use it).
# But it is something you need to consider when you are writing programs.


# Numeric operator

a = 12
b = 3

print(a+b)  # ans - 15
print(a-b)  # ans - 9
print(a * b) # ans - 36
print(a/b) # ans 4.0
print(a//b) # ans - 4 integer division, round down towards minus infinity
print(a % b) # 0 module: the reminder after integer division

print()

for i in range(1, a//b):
    print(i)

# TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer  - if the range is typed as range(1, a/b)
# this is an example that python is strongly typed - we cant float where a int must be used.


# Expression - eg -  a , b, 12, 3, a+b , a-b, a*b, ... line 36 we have 1 , (a//b) = 4, and
# range(1, a//b) is also an experssion as python has to evaluate a range of experssion from 1 to 4,
# and finally print(i) is also an experssion
# total there as - 26 experssion

# OPERATOR PRECEDENCE -
## PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, (Multiplication/Division), (Addition/Substraction)
print()

print(a + b / 3 - 4 * 12)
print(a + (b / 3) - (4 * 12))
print((((a+b)/3)-4) * 12)
print(((a + b)/3 - 4) * 12)
